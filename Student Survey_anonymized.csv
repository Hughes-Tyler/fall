I believe this is an important (mission-wise) and marketable (financially) niche to appeal to. However, my experience so far at Augustin College has been primarily with full-time students who had either immediately or recently completed their undergraduate degree, often from Veritus Imperial University. That's fine - my classmates have all been smart and engaged - but the class conversations often lack the depth that I was expecting from a college designed for students with diverse professional and personal experiences. It also leaves me somewhat confused as to what the mission and target audience of Augustin College is supposed to be. Again, the classes are great, and the classmates are great, but I do not feel like I am really experiencing (or maybe I misunderstand it) an academic program designed for nontraditional students / professionals."

Proposed Structure:

Assignment Release: Every Monday

Assignment Due Date: The following Monday

Time Zone: Clearly stated and consistent (e.g., 11:59 PM EST)

Rationale:

Predictability: A uniform weekly schedule helps students plan their work and personal time more effectively.

Reduced Cognitive Load: Eliminates the need to manage multiple inconsistent course calendars.

Improved Time Management: Encourages students to establish a regular weekly routine, which can lead to better performance and reduced stress.",Very important,Moderately important,Not at all important,Not at all important,Not at all important,Not at all important,Not at all important,Not at all important,Not at all important,Not at all important,Not at all important,Not at all important,Not at all important,Moderately important,Not at all important,Not at all important,Not at all important,Not at all important,Not at all important,Extremely important,Not at all important,Moderately important,Moderately important,Moderately important,Moderately important,Not at all important,Slightly important,Moderately important,Moderately important,Not at all important,Moderately important,Moderately important,,Moderately important,Extremely important,Moderately important,Not at all important,Very important,Moderately important,Very important,Moderately important,Moderately important,

At my workplace, we have just integrated AI with the purchase of an electric mower that has learned to mow a quarter of the property I manage. A seminar or 1 credit course that specifically educates students on navigating the integration of AI in work environments would be very helpful, informational, and may help save people's jobs; or at least get them prepared to look for a new career path."

- Pre or Post-work assignments should not be due until the previous week's assignment has been graded. Submitting assignments without receiving feedback from a previous assignment leaves the student lost. and asking if they are on the right track. 

- Group work causes more harm than good. I thought this program would have more part-time students and almost no full-time students. I have found that many of my classes lack part-time students, creating a massive divide of when people are available. I think group work is important, but it should not be emphasized as much as it is. The most difficult part of the assignment is generally finding time to meet and it takes away from the actual assignment. 

- If Blackboard is going to be used, then the assignment due dates should match what is shown in the application. I am now in my third class, where a teacher posts a due date for an assignment that does not match the application. If a teacher is going to ask for discussion due one day but replies are due another, then it should show as two different assignments in the application with two different due dates.
